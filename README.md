# NodeJS-Project

### Description

This Node.js project highlights the use of essential APIs such as Buffer, File System, HTTP, and includes advanced concepts like modular design, package management, Express framework, and Mongoose for database handling. The project provides practical examples that demonstrate how these core features can be applied in real-world scenarios. Itâ€™s designed to offer a comprehensive overview of Node.js capabilities, serving as a foundation for developing more sophisticated applications while illustrating best practices in server-side development.



### Project Structure
